# The Oracle of Bacon T10 Challenge

## <b>Context</b>
[The Oracle of Bacon](https://oracleofbacon.org/help.php) is a web game where the object of the game is to start with any actor or actress who has been in a movie and connect them to Kevin Bacon in the smallest number of links possible. Two people are linked if they've been in a movie together.

The game is based on the [Six degrees of Separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation), which is the idea that all people are separated by six (or fewer) social connections from each other. Also known as the **6 Handshakes Rule.**

## <b>About the Challenge</b>
Your job is to implement a somewhat similar version of the Oracle of Bacon based on the concept six degrees of seperation. It's up to you to decide which feature(s) you are to implement given the time constraint, however feel free to fork this repo and push changes to your own github account. We will give you a few days to improve your submission (any changes pushed after the deadline **will not be evaluated**, but please feel free to improve your code as much as you'd like).

To help you decide a MVP for your live coding session, here's an example:
- Find the shortest path between Kevin Bacon and any given person. 

## <b>Data</b>
The data is from the [IMDB](https://imdb-api.com/) website corresponding containing information about movies and cast.

## <b>Evaluation</b>
The evaluation will be 90% based on the live coding session in which we will evaluate best practices in both software development and data science spectra. Regardless of that we want you to feel free to work how you normally would in a day-to-day scenario, don't worry **WE DO NOT EXPECT YOU TO DELIVER EVERYTHING** in the live coding session. Keeping in mind "quality over quantity" is something we at T10 praise and follow.
